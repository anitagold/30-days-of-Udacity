# 30-days-of-Udacity
## What is the #30DaysofUdacity challenge?
The premise of this challenge is to build a habit of practicing new skills by making a public commitment of practicing the topic of your program every day for 30 days. 
## Why? 
Because habits that emphasize consistent practice have been proven to help overall retention of new learning material.
